	<h2>Conflict</h2>
<p>I think my conflict resolution skills in general are pretty lacking. Looking over the compass of shame documentation I think I fall pretty cleanly into attacks self and withdrawal. I tend to react to conflict by getting angry at myself or by attempting to avoid the situation entirely.</p>
<p>A perfect example would be how my student loans kept piling up and piling up and I just kept ignoring them and hoping they would go away. This of course did not happen, and it culminated with the collections company garnishing my wages (a situation I don't quite understand. If someone is not making enough to make payments it seems to be to be counterintuitive to make them have even less money to make their payments, but I don't think collection companies are much concerned with anything besides their bottom line anyway.</p>
<p> I think the main cause of problem wasn't the problem itself, but was rather how I dealt with it. If I had confronted the problem head on and attempted to call the collection agencies to get them to relent, it would never have gotten so bad. I would have never ended up in the situation I was on. I am not saying that confrontation is the best course of action for resolving all problems, but it clearly was not the correct one in this case. Perhaps the answer is that you need to sit down and think through how you're going to address a problem in order to end up with a conclusion that doesn't suck</p>
