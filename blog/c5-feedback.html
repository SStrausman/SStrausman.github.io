	<h2>Workin' on a full house</h2>
	<p><p>The thing with pairing for me is that its very hit or miss. There are some people who I just connect with and we can quickly work together to find the solution, and there are some people who it is immensely frustrating to work with because we clearly are not able to communicate with each other on the same wave length. I've had several of both of these pairing types by now and I'd like to present a list of things that I think leads to a good pairing session.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be prepared</li>
Make sure that you have both at least looked through the challenge in advance and have some idea of what to expect. My most frustrating and least productive moments in challenge are when we have to spend time either silently reading the challenge or awkwardly reading aloud to each other instead of being able to begin a discussion of how to begin solving it.
<li>Have an in depth discussion of expectations</li>
This can include many things. For me, it mainly includes clarifying driver/navigator, since I struggle with the distinction a bit on my own. If both of us are confused and are using different definitions, I think it adds an extra layer of confusion to the whole proceedings that is hard to overcome. This step also includes a discussion of whats going on with you so that both parties have good expectations of what should be happening.
<li>Feedback comes before the end</li>
I really think we should be giving feedback all the time. One of the most important parts of feed back is that we can use it to do things better faster stronger etc. Why would we wait til after the pairing session to express ways that we think we could be clearer or more concise or more open to new ideas. I've found that giving feedback while working on challenges ends up making the session go smoother.
</ol>
<p>I think the after the fact feedback is pretty hard to parse without knowing who its from. I think that the anonymous nature, while desirable for other reasons, means the feedback is not as effective. I think being able to pair my feedback to the specific context in which it would given would inherently help with actionability. Context is king. </p>

<p>In general, I found most of the feedback I've received to be pretty unhelpful. I think people in my cohort seem to be looking at it like a yelp review or something. “Good job! Would pair with you again!” may be kind, but it doesn't tell my anything. You can be actionable and specific even with your praise. I think thats missing in a lot of the feedback I get. I feel like we could all get better at the first two parts.</p>

<p>On the flip side, its HARD to write feedback. Especially for the stage of the program where we were all basically just fumbling around blindly. </p>

<p>I like pairing, but sometimes it makes me nervous and panicky. If I don't know an answer right away, it feeds into my already problematic imposter loop, where I get down on myself and think I'm stupid and that I can't do anything right. I actually had to drop out mid call because I was unable to think or answer the most simple questions from my partner. I felt like I was just wasting both of our time. I think this represents the most fundamental hurdle I need to overcome, not just in pairing, but in DBC in general. I see something and I'm not immediately able to figure it out so I seize up and end up panicked which in turn makes me even less likely to be able to understand what's going on. Both in pairs and out of them I have to come up with ways to avoid this feeling, or at least comping mechanisms that allow me to push past it. I'll get there. I hope.</p></p>
