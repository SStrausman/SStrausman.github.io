	<h2>Everyone Looks Just Like Me</h2>
	<p><p>I think the biggest problem facing the tech community right now is diversity. This isn't news, as one of the biggest facing STEM fields, as well as just the world in general right now, is diversity. One of the most encouraging things to me about dev bootcamp, and my cohort in particular, is that they do seem to be trying to address issues of systemic discrimination in the tech world. My cohort is remarkably diverse and that is awesome.</p>
<p>The problem is that this isn't the case in general. Just this week we had another industry giant <a href=”http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/03/amazon-diversity-2014/”>release a diversity report</a> that showcases a lot of the same trends we see over the entire industry. There are pressures upon not-white non-male figures in the industry that are pervasive, and its clear that the major players are not doing enough to combat them. If tech is going to shape how we speak in the next century, it is deeply disturbing to me that so many people seem to not have a voice by default.</p>
<p>One of the major issues, I think, is lack of awareness. In that sense, the fact that we're getting all these crappy diversity reports is a good thing, because it makes it harder and harder for people to pretend that tech is a diverse field. I've had conversations with a lot of friends who are developers, and by and large it boils down to straight white males not realizing there is actually a problem. It's hard to see systemic oppression when you are not the one being actively oppressed, but that is exactly what we have to show the larger community.</p>
<p>As far as fixing it goes, I don't think there's an easy solution. The problems are ingrained in many different systems, from privileged hiring practices to the way women are treated in traditionally male dominated spaces (see #GamerGate et. al). I think scholarships are a good start. I think open dialogues about hiring practices are a good start. I think early education in coding regardless of gender is a good start. I also think its critical that we make and protect safe spaces for people who are marginalized to learn how to code. </p>
<p>The greatest threat to the fight against systemic discrimination is the idea that the battle has already been one. We have got to destroy that notion. We have got to continue to break down the barriers to coding. I love listening to voices from every different perspective, and its so disheartening to turn to the tech community and hear voices that primarily come just from people exactly like me.</p></p>
