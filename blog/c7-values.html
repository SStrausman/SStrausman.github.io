<p>I was looking over the list and if I'm really honest when I think back to the times I was happiest in my life, I think it was when I was fully sharing who I was as a person with someone else. I think it was a close-interlinking of my mind with another person. The closest thing on the list that you have there is “romance”, which I do not think covers precisely the value I am thinking of here. Much more close would be something like intimacy. I value relationships with others that are fulfilling and intimate and that is a huge part of what makes me happy.</p>

<li>accomplishment Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <b>4</b> ----- 5 Agree</li>
<li>friendships Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <b>5</b> Agree </li>

<li>helping society Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <b>3</b> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</li>
<li>independence Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <b>5</b> Agree</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly the last time someone asked me for advice was when my friend was thinking about applying to dev bootcamp and she wanted to know if I thought she would be a good fit.</p>

<p>As I said in my stereotype threat blog post, I feel like this is less an issue for me than it is for other people. Part of my privilege as a white straight cis male is that people generally have favorable expectations of me. I do think that the things I mentioned (and other values I hold, obviously) do help me try to fight stereotyping that I might do that would contribute to other peoples senses of unease.</p>

<p>As for feeling down, my roommate tells me that she thinks my biggest issue with regards to dev bootcamp is impostor syndrome. I don't trust myself to be right and I get down easily with regards to not being able to figure something out. I need to be able to trust myself more often, and that is probably related to self respect, fairness (to myself) and other things not discussed. </p>
