	<h2>Ch-ch-ch-CHANGING</h2>
<p>I think the main difference that I encountered when going over JS as opposed to ruby is syntax. There are things that work slightly differently (I.E. Hashes vs. objects. And boy, let me tell you, after 6 weeks of “everything is an object” being drilled into my head, an object being called an object was a bit of a mind-screw.) but for me the biggest challenges came from learning that in many ways things have to be written completely differently.</p>
<p>For instance, the do loop, where you want to do something x number of times seemed much more messy to me. In ruby I would write something very simple like </p>
<p></p>
<p>20.times do p "cow"</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Whereas in JS it involves a for loop and much more coding. When I was talking to Emmanuel during my GPS he pointed out to me that a lot of this is because of how far ruby is removed from C. Since JS is closer, you have more power and ability to customize what you're doing. That makes the language more flexible, but less intuitive. Since ruby is simplifying a lot of things for you it means it is often more intuitive, but less powerful.</p>
<p>I'm still forgetting to name my variables correctly. The ruby convention of first_second is very different from the Javascript firstSecond. Honestly, I don't really understand the need to conventionalize names like that. I guess it just boils down to preference.</p>
<p> What I do know is that I spent roughly 20 minutes yesterday trying to figure out why my damn code wasn't working and the answer was that I didn't notice I was missing a single comma in a seemingly random place between functions within an object. That was fun.</p>
<p>This blog post seems less about teaching and more about how I am annoyed by syntax issues which I am just going to have to get used to.</p>
