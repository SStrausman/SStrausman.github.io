	<h2>Array's and Hashes, or how I am too tired to think of a clever title.</h2>
	<p>The main difference between hashes and arrays seems to me to be what you are indexing them to. That is, arrays are indexed to integers, starting at 0. The first value in an array is 0, second is 1, third is 2 and so on. On the other hand, hashes are indexed to whatever you chose to index them to. It's like a collection of value pairs. You choose what they are indexed to so that you can store values separate from just sequential numbers.

A good way to think about it, I think, is the difference between a list of things and a collection of associations. The list is just an ordered grouping of things. 
Names [Shea, Jess, Roger, Rachael, Someone] is akin to having a list of names, which looks like
0: Shea
1: Jess
2: Roger
3: Rachael
4: Someone.

Whereas a hash, like so, Names = {Shea: 'me', Jess: 'roommate', Roger: 'friend', Rachael: 'coworker', Someone: 'Stranger'}.

They're good for different things. Arrays are good for keeping track of lists which you want to manipulate. Hashes are good for keeping track of a category of things and what the values of all those things are.</p>
