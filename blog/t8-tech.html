	<h2>Teaching to the test</h2>
<p> In a former life I thought I was going to be an English teacher. I loved words. I loved reading. I was passionate about kids learning a love of these things to. Then, the big bad wolf of the teaching world tried to eat my little red riding hood. You see, American schools aren't doing so hot. Due to the no child left behind act and several other national education reforms, teachers were forced to meet a more and more stringent set of standards which often required them to teach not in a way that was best for education, but rather in a way that was best for getting students to pass specific standardized tests (the common core actually fixes a lot of these problems! Hoorah!)</p>
<p>I share this story not because it has any particular relevance outside of the name, simply because that's the first place my mind when when I heard the phrase “test-driven,” which of course is what I am writing about here: Test-driven development. Or the idea that you write code to test for the minimum functionality, (the MVP, or minimum viable product) and then write code that attempts to pass those tests. Luckily, TDD is much more intuitive and serves a much less insidious purpose than the teaching to the test that I was mentioning earlier</p>
<p>TDD starts with user stories or use cases, features essentially, which are each turned into a specific test. If that test fails, the dev writes some code to try to make it not fail. Intermittent testing and coding happen here until all the tests are passed. It is important to not worry if the solution is the best or inelegant at this stage in development. If it passes, you can fix all the issues with it in the next stage, which is refactoring.</p>
<p> Like everything, there are strengths and weaknesses to this approach. Studies have found that devs who operate under this model are often more productive and it leads to compartmentalized code that is easily broken apart and can be reverted back to a working version (without the feature that was added) very easily. </p>
<p>It is very important to have a thorough understanding of the scope and intended functionality of the program when you are doing TDD, because if your tests are not testing for the right things you may have just written a boatload of completely functional code that doesn't do any of the things you want it to do.</p>
