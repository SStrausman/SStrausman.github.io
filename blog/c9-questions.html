<p>“Does anyone have tips for refactoring they'd like to share? I feel like I don't even know what I'm looking for when I'm refactoring so I just end up basically just with the same exact code.</p>

<p>If anyone has a process they use for refactoring it might be useful to share it so that we can compare/figure out what is the best things to be looking for? I know I would benefit from this.</p>

<p>Thanks guys!﻿"</P>

<p>This is a question I asked on the google+ page that I felt did not really get satisfactorily answered. I think there are two parts of this. First, I don't think I was specific enough. I have brought up a topic, and asked for examples of peoples processes, which does give an idea of how I'd like the questions answered (in general, not specific) but I think it ends up being a particularly hard question to answer because of the nature of refactoring: all refactors are going to be different, since they depend on the code that you are looking at.</p>

<p>I think if I were going to repost this question today I would say something like “Here is a piece of code that I have been working on. If you could take your process and show me how you could apply it to this code I would appreciate it” or say something like “If you could post a piece of code of yours and show me how you used your process to refactor it to the final result” that would have probably been an easier question for people to answer. </p>

<p>It is, however, also worthwhile to note, I think, that some people are not always interested in answering your questions, but are rather interested in demonstrating their own cleverness. It's important to recognize when someone is just trying to show off rather than be helpful. I don't think this will be an issue at DBC and I'm not saying it has necessarily been an issue on the google+ boards, but its definitely something I've noticed, being from the internet. Not everyone is helpful or even interested in being helpful. Not all questions don't get answered correctly because of something the questioner did incorrectly.</p>

<p>Honest self assessment is very important here.</p>
