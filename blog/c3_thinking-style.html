	<p>I tend to not put much faith in these sorts of cognitive style tests, and this is why: Last time I took this test at the beginning of DBC I was the complete opposite of what it is saying I am now. Has the first three weeks of DBC changed me that much? I doubt it. I think I probably think much the same as I did coming in. (although I am continuing with that meditation stuff. It's pretty cool.)</p>

<p>I think that we all can slip in and out of all of these different modes of thinking depending on our mood, depending on how comfortable we are with a project, depending on a lot of things really. I think, then, the key is probably to figure out how you're approaching a specific problem, and figure out what your mind needs at that time to solve it. Sometimes I need to experiment for a while to find the right solution. Sometimes I need to read an instruction manual that walks me through the process step by step. I think the key is figuring out what you need to learn in order to do so at any given time, and being able to do this will definitely help.</p>

<p>In terms of struggling, my greatest weakness is still time management. I'm slowly getting better at doing the work (it's been so long since I've been in school!) but I still feel as if its a mad dash to the finish line each week, instead of a paced out and informative stroll. I'd like to make it more in depth, less hurried, and less stressful, though I'm finding that in the pie chart of my time with the three categories DBC, Work and Social life, there isn't much space for the last category. I'm having to actively think of when I can schedule free time, and that's something I'm not accustomed to. Not saying its a bad thing, but it's certainly an adjustment. </p>

<p>With regards to the fixed vs. growth mindset, I think my main issue is just pushing down self-doubt. Everyone has some self doubt, but when its rooted in thoughts like "I'm not smart enough to do this" or "I don't know any of this stuff." its not helpful. Of course I don't know this stuff, I'm just learning it right now, and none of that relates to my intelligence in any way. I just need to recognize the thoughts I am having that have negative effects on my abilities and be able to start trying to counter them.</p>
