	<h2>In which I discuss how nerdy I am.</h2>
	<p><p>The main reason to use your own classes as far as I can see is that they are more efficient if you're worried about scaling. If you are going to have a lot of different instances of the same type of object, it makes sense to store the characteristics of that object permanently so that your program can quickly and easily access them and remember them, and so you can easily make more of those objects.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert, guys. And I am sure this is totally not already apparent, but Shea is a huge nerd. A HUGE nerd. I play a card game called magic the gathering at a fairly serious competitive level. If any of you have been following me on twitter, you'll see that it (along with sports and burritos) consumes almost all of my non-professional interest. In magic, there are tons of cards. Tens of thousands of them. It would suck to have to create them all individually. So, why not make a class called card?</p>

<p>Class Card</p>

I<p>nside of this class we could store all sorts of things that are on a magic card. </p>

<p>Behold! The venerable grizzly bears!</p>

<p>We can store all this stuff about it by saying that all objects of the class card have instance variables like card_name, card_type (creature, instant, sorcery, land, artifact, enchantment, planeswalker, etc. Our good buddy G. Bears up there is a creature.), rules text (Mr. Bears doesn't have any rules text! He's just a big ol' vanilla bear.) flavor_text (whole bunch of that on this one) and anything else we thought each object of this type ought to know about itself. </p>

<p>Of course, magic cards are not the only kinds of cards, so it's kind of lame that we're assuming they are with this object. Wouldn't it be cool if we could create a class MagicCard and it would have all the special characteristics of a magic card, but also would get some traits passed down to it because all cards are the same? Well, we can! We could create a class called Cards and give it methods and variables that pass down to the class MagicCard because of inheritance. It makes sense to do this because a magic card is a type of card! </p>

<p>Isn't that awesome? Classes are awesome.</p>
