Doctor Strange Git: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Hub

Think of the sweet adventure games you used to play as a kid. Remember how your mom would call you to dinner? 
"Now!" she'd say.
"But Moommmmmmmmmmmmm!" you'd groan. "I'm not at a save point yet!"
Think of version control as the save point you were begging to be allowed to hit. If something happened, like, say, your moms world famous tripe and mushroom casserole, or that boss on level 12 who repeatedly kicked your ass, you could go back to the save point and you wouldn't have to start all over again.
In git, version control works the same way. If you make a mistake in your code and you can't figure out where it is, instead of wasting tons of time you can just revert back to the previous version. It's like a time warp. 
Remember how in the example above you had to wait for the actual save point to save your progress? Well, the best thing about version control is that you get to decide where your save points are. You take all the changes you've made and you make a commit, which as far I can tell is fancy programmer speak for "all of the changes you've made." Then you can push these changes to git hub and can see when every change was made and by whom.
Oh, we forgot about that part, didn't we? One of the best parts of version control is how it enables collaboration. It gives you a working list of all the changes that have been made and by what person so that there is not duplicated effort, and, if there is confusion over some code, you can just be like oh snap, Roger made that code like 3 days ago. Let me ask him what's up with that. Then you call up Roger and you have a nice talk about Final Fantasy 7 and he's like I've gotta go because my mom is calling me and you're like but wait Roger I called you because I wanted to know what this code does and then he's like oh snap yeah I was trying to do XYZ things and such.
You get the picture. Roger is a good dude.
Anyway. Git tracks your changes by tracking every change that has ever been made to the code over the entire course of time. It also makes sure that everyone has the most current and up to date version of whatever you're working in. It does this by synthesizing the work of multiple people into one file. This is pretty cool because it stops you from duplicating effort. 
The value of git hub is that it really super charges git. I remember in the git section we were to watch a movie about git and how it worked and what not and I found it kind of confusing that it was describing git as a cloud, because really it seems to me like GitHub is the cloud, which allows you to access whatever you're working on with git from any location. It's like a remote server to store your code. This is also pretty cool for the colaboration because its what allows people to share and interact with each others code without having to mail each other floppies and other such nonsense. Man. Did I just date myself? Do y'all remember floppies? Floppies ruled. I read somewhere that in order to have the amount of memory my computer has you'd have to have like 2000 floppy disks. I feel old.
So. Hopefully that was helpful. As a brief summary we've covered version control, how git tracks your files, the difference between git and github, and how frikken inefficient floppy disks are. Hope this was helpful! Over and out, Shea!
