	<h2>You down with OOP? (yeah you know me)</h2>
	<p>Ruby has many different kinds of variables that you can use to achieve your ends. They are visable to different kinds of objects and have different other characteristics. They are generally created using a special symbol at the front.<p>
<ul><li>this_is_a_local_variable</li>
<li>$this_is_a_global_variable</li>
<li>@this_is_an_instance_variable</li>
<li>@@this_is_a_class_variable</li>
<li>THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT_VARIABLE</li></ul>

<p>Local variables are your garden variety type. They are only visable, accessable and changible within the local block where they are set. </p>

<p>Global variables are visible and changible from anywhere in the code. From what I can gather they are generally not a great idea for that very reason. When your global variable is accessable and readable from anywhere, it means it can be very hard to track down where you are getting errors.</p>

<p>Instance variables are scoped to objects within that class, however, changing an instance variable within a specific class object will not change that variable for all other objects of that class which makes it different from our next little guy, who is a </p>

<p>Class variable. Class variables are scoped to all objects of that class. If you change a class variable it changes for all objects of that class, which is the main difference between it and the instance variable just discussed.</p>

<p>Constants in ruby function differently from how they do in most other languages. In ruby, you can change a constant, which is a little mind bending to think about. However, you will get a warning in terminal when you do this, and you really should not do this unless there is a really good reason in the code to do so.</p>
