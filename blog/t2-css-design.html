	<h2>Dear God Do I Hate CSS</h2>
	<p>So, margin borders and padding. As near as I can tell. Using this box model. It's hard to talk about something that I haven't really wrapped my brain around yet, but I will try. Maybe through the course of this blog I will come to understand the concept better. 
	The margin seems to be the distance between the edge of the screen and the border. Similarly, the border is the difference between the margin and the padding. The padding is the difference between the border and the actual content that you are using HTML to generate.
	YOu can change the distances of the element from different other things by changing the sizes of those different settings.</p>
