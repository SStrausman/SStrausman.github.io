I'm Ok (trust me)

10/15/2014
I feel like I'm kind of lucky because I have a roommate who has already been through this before. We've spent a lot of time talking through expectations and whatnot, so none of this was particularly surprising to me. It's good to hear it again though. Repetition helps you internalize, I think, which I also think will be the biggest challenge. It's one thing to know in your mind that you are not very far behind and that you are good enough and you have the capacity or whatever. It's another thing entirely to internalize that and know it in your heart as well. I suffer from a lot of self-doubt as a default (who doesn't, I guess?) so it's an active struggle for me to constantly keep pushing those thoughts down and reinforcing a growth mindset instead of a fixed one.

A lot of the talk seemed to focus on how much work this will be and how stressful this will be and how much effort will be required. Again, I think that's something I can understand intellectually, but its hard to really know the full scope until you're actually immersed. I'm beginning to get the impression that this is going to be the hardest 2.5 months of my life, but "getting that impression" seems different from actually experiencing it. I have some trepidation with regards to this as well, because its been a very long time since I was completely new to something and had to learn from the ground up. I haven't been in school for a long time now, and even then, I don't think I ever worked as hard as it appears to me I am going to have to here. I worry about not being able to adjust to the workload, which, if I'm thinking positively, has caused me to try to start putting structure in place even now that will help me cope.

Despite all of that I'm feeling a sort of "bring it!" attitude. Being able to do the challenges this week has given me little bit of (what is perhaps false) confidence that I CAN do this stuff if I put my mind to it. It's all mental at this point.
