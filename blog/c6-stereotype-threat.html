	<h2>Wherein I stumble around over something I haven't thought about before</h2>
	<p>Stereotype threat is the idea that people can often conform to low expectations which are based off of a stereotyped understanding of a certain groups abilities. It has been shown to effect many different groups, but most notably females in mathematics and minorities (whether they be racial or socio-economic in nature) with regards to academic achievement.</p>

<p>This assignment doesn't effect me as much as it does others in my cohort. As a white, straight, cis male expectations culturally and academically for me are in general pretty high. I am stereotyped in a way which is positive to me, and that is part of the privilege that I carry with me due to the factors outlined above. I wasn't well off, but I don't really feel as if this effects me academically, and I have progressed far enough from that part of my life that it is not immediately apparent to those around me. Put simply, my relatively low economic status growing up no longer represents a fundamental part of my identity, so I don't think it really matters in this situation.</p>

<p>I think the key part of this challenge for me is understanding that sometimes others go through this, and it ties in quite nicely to the blog post that I wrote a couple weeks ago about the place of women in tech. I am responsible for creating the environment that I and my peers work, and I need to be mindful of my effects on that environment, which includes keeping in mind how my words and my biases can effect the abilities of those around me. I need to actively work towards creating an environment which does not reinforce stereotypes about my peers, since that is where this comes from.</p>

<p>I remember back in college I noticed a trend: in group projects male members tended to be the ones who did the speaking. The ones who drove the groups. The ones who presented findings to the class. I wonder if this is part and parcel with the concept of the stereotype threat, where men feel more comfortable in these roles precisely because it is the expectation of society that we should excel in them. That seems like all the more reason to actively confound those expectations. </p>
