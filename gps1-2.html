        <p><h3>What is pair programming.</h3>
            Pair programming is when two programmers work together to colaborate on code. One person takes a driver role and the other person takes a navigator role and they combine their skills, including programming, problem solving and communication, to solve the problem.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
          <p><h3>Why is pair programming important ?</h3> Pair programming is important because it allows you to switch off roles and learn both by watching someone more experienced and from having someone experienced mentor you while you learn. It allows allows for easy collaboration as well as quick editing and code checking.</h3></p>

          <p><h3>Compare driver and navigator</h3>
              The way Rayan and Shea envisioned driver navigator was the driver role has their hands on the keyboard. They are inputting the code directly and collaborating with the navigator through the progress as well as implementing the actual code. The navigators role is more big picture. They are conceptualizing the code and instructing the driver on what they should be working on, along with getting constant feedback on the direction of the project. We switched off, having Shea drive during the HTML and Rayan drive during the CSS portion which really helped Shea out because he felt a lot weaker at CSS and it helped to watch someone who knew a deeper level of CSS.
          </p><p><h3>Shea's reflection</h3>
              Rayan and I had a very nice rapport. I think we communicated really well and got the task done nicely. I appreciated his help with the CSS. I think that pairs are really good tools when you both communicate well. The hardest part seems to be geting that correct. Once you communicate well, you can figure out any challenge.
